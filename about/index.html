<h3><a href="http://bashfulbytes.com/gwc/#teachingteam">Breanna Devore-McDonald</a></h3>

<p>Hey guys, my name is Breanna and I'll be your instructor for the summer! I just
finished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Notre Dame,
and in September I'll be starting my PhD at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
I have a severe passion for dogs (don't even talk to me about Workday's dog-friendly
campus, I'm already crying), I could live off avocados, I spend too much money on makeup
and Star Wars memorabilia, and I love advocating for underrepresented communities in 
computer science. Ask me about linux, my dog Teek, and why I think computer science
is just philosophy with numbers.</p>

<h3><a href="http://bashfulbytes.com/gwc/#teachingteam">Emily Fong</a></h3>

<p>My name is Emily, and I'm a student at NYU. My major is a combination of Computer
Science, Women's Studies, Critical Race Theory, and Postcolonial Theory. When
I'm not smashing patriarchy, I'm experimenting with baking recipes or building
things with Arduino and Adafruit. I love dogs, memes, and crying at female
empowerment movies. </p>

<h3><a href="http://bashfulbytes.com/gwc/#teachingteam">Milena Gonzalez</a></h3>

<p>Hello ladies! I am so excited to be working with you all
this summer :) I am a rising sophomore at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
majoring in Computer Science with possible concentrations in math or games. I
am also a GWC alumna! I did my SIP at GE in San Ramon in 2014. Some of my
favorite hobbies include closing the gender gap, encouraging more diversity in
tech, listening to Beyonc√©, eating good food (usually sushi), drawing, and
adventuring around the Bay.</p>
